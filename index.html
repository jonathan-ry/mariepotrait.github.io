    <p>Elevator buttons and morning air
        Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
        If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
        But right now my time is theirs
        Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
        They'll judge it like they know about me and you
        And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
        The jury's out, but my choice is you
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours
        You never know what people have up their sleeves
        Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
        Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
        But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine
        And you'll say
        Don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours
        And it's not theirs to speculate
        If it's wrong, and your hands are tough
        But they are where mine belong, and
        I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
        With this song for you
        'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
        And I love the riddles that you speak
        And any snide remarks from my father
        About your tattoos will be ignored
        'Cause my heart is yours
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        And don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        But they can't take what's ours
        They can't take what's ours

        But right now my time is theirs
        Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
        They'll judge it like they know about me and you
        And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
        The jury's out, but my choice is you
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours
        You never know what people have up their sleeves
        Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
        Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
        But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine
        And you'll say
        Don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours
        And it's not theirs to speculate
        If it's wrong, and your hands are tough
        But they are where mine belong, and
        I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
        With this song for you
        'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
        And I love the riddles that you speak
        And any snide remarks from my father
        About your tattoos will be ignored
        'Cause my heart is yours
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        And don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        But they can't take what's ours
        They can't take what's ours
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours Elevator buttons and morning air
        Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
        If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
        But right now my time is theirs
        Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
        They'll judge it like they know about me and you

        But this love is ours
        You never know what people have up their sleeves
        Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
        Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
        But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine
        And you'll say
        Don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours
        And it's not theirs to speculate
        If it's wrong, and your hands are tough
        But they are where mine belong, and
        I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
        With this song for you
        'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
        And I love the riddles that you speak
        And any snide remarks from my father
        About your tattoos will be ignored
        'Cause my heart is yours
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        And don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        But they can't take what's ours
        They can't take what's ours
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours Elevator buttons and morning air
        Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
        If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
        But right now my time is theirs
        Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
        They'll judge it like they know about me and you
        And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
        The jury's out, but my choice is you
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard

        But this love is ours
        And it's not theirs to speculate
        If it's wrong, and your hands are tough
        But they are where mine belong, and
        I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
        With this song for you
        'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
        And I love the riddles that you speak
        And any snide remarks from my father
        About your tattoos will be ignored
        'Cause my heart is yours
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        And don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        But they can't take what's ours
        They can't take what's ours
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours Elevator buttons and morning air
        Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
        If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
        But right now my time is theirs
        Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
        They'll judge it like they know about me and you
        And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
        The jury's out, but my choice is you
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours
        You never know what people have up their sleeves
        Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
        Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
        But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine
        And you'll say
        Don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours
        And it's not theirs to speculate
        If it's wrong, and your hands are tough
        But they are where mine belong, and
        I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
        With this song for you
        'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
        And I love the riddles that you speak
        And any snide remarks from my father
        About your tattoos will be ignored
        'Cause my heart is yours
        So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        And life makes love look hard
        And don't you worry your pretty, little mind
        People throw rocks at things that shine
        But they can't take what's ours
        They can't take what's ours
        The stakes are high, the water's rough
        But this love is ours </p>
